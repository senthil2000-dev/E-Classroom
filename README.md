# E-Classroom
## A place where tutors can record lectures with webcam in browser or upload videos(by receiving otp if it is an authorised email) in any format, create playlists, merge videos into a single video and students can access them by filtering by department and specialisation, can subscribe, can search for videos by filtering by either date or views and there is also a forum to post q &amp; a below each video and lots more!
### ffmpeg (windows server required) folder has to be downloaded and added in the root directory before using xampp to run this
### database lectures.sql has to be imported into phpmyadmin and the file includes/config.php has to be changed according to your host and database connection
#### 3 videos 'tour through my website' has been enclosed in this repository which highlights all the features of the website (has to be downloaded and seen)
